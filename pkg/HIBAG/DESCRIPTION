Description: HIBAG is a state of the art software package for imputing HLA
    types using SNP data, and it uses the R statistical programming language.
    HIBAG can be used by researchers with published parameter estimates instead
    of requiring access to large training sample datasets. It combines the
    concepts of attribute bagging, an ensemble classifier method, with
    haplotype inference for SNPs and HLA types. Attribute bagging is a
    technique which improves the accuracy and stability of classifier
    ensembles using bootstrap aggregating and random variable selection.
