Description:    This package provides a high-level R interface to CoreArray
    Genomic Data Structure (GDS) data files, which are portable across
    platforms and include hierarchical structure to store multiple scalable
    array-oriented data sets with metadata information. It is suited for
    large-scale datasets, especially for data which are much larger than the
    available random-access memory. The gdsfmt package offers the efficient
    operations specifically designed for integers with less than 8 bits, since
    a single genetic/genomic variant, like single-nucleotide polymorphism,
    usually occupies fewer bits than a byte. Data compression and decompression
    are also supported with relatively efficient random access. It is allowed
    to read a GDS file in parallel with multiple R processes supported by the
    parallel package.
